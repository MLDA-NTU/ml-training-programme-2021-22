              "'The Nanyang Technological University (NTU) is a national research university based in Singapore. It is the second oldest autonomous university in Singapore and is considered to be one of the top universities in the world. NTU is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world according to most rankings, and is currently ranked 12th globally in the QS World University Rankings as of June 2021. It has also been ranked 1st amongst young universities by the QS World University Rankings since 2015 as of April 2021As a relatively large university, it has 23,951 full-time enrolled students and 3846 full-time teaching staff. \\nThe university is organised into several colleges and schools, including the College of Engineering, College of Science, Nanyang Business School, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Graduate College, National Institute of Education, and S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. NTU is also home to several Research Centres of Excellence such as the Earth Observatory of Singapore and Singapore Centre on Environmental Life Sciences Engineering. \\nNTU\\'s main campus covers 200 hectares (490 acres) of land, making it the largest university campus in Singapore. The primary campus grounds are located in the western part of Singapore, along 50 Nanyang Avenue. It also has two other campuses in Singapore\\'s healthcare and start-up districts, Novena and one-north respectively.\\n\\nHistory\\nNanyang University (1955–1980)\\nIn 1955, prior to Singapore\\'s independence from the British, Nanyang University was established south of the current Nanyang Technological University campus, with the centre of the present Yunnan Garden as its heart. Its administration building currently houses the Chinese Heritage Centre, a national monument.\\n\\nNanyang Technological Institute (1981–1991)\\nIn 1980, Nanyang University merged with the University of Singapore to form the current National University of Singapore. In complement, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI), a tertiary institution affiliated to the National University of Singapore, was formed to take over Nanyang University\\'s campus in 1981.Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was set up on 1 August 1981 with a charter to train three-quarters of Singapore’s engineers.\\nWhen NTI started in 1982, it had a total student population of 582 in three engineering disciplines – civil and structural, electrical and electronic, and mechanical and production engineering. By 1990, the institute’s undergraduate student population had grown to 6,832. The first two graduate students were admitted in 1986.\\nThree engineering schools were added, and the School of Accountancy from the National University of Singapore was transferred to NTI in 1987. A school of applied science was also started. In 1990, the government announced that the Institute of Education would be merged with the College of Physical Education to form the National Institute of Education and that it would be part of the new NTU upon its establishment in 1991.\\n\\nPresent form\\nIn 1991, NTI merged with the National Institute of Education (NIE) (founded in 1950) to form the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The alumni rolls of the former Nanyang University were transferred to NTU in 1996. Historically, Nanyang Technological University admitted students jointly with the affiliated National University of Singapore and charged the same fees. Students made only one application and they would be accepted by either university. This arrangement ended in 2004 as both universities began to distinguish themselves with an end of its official affiliation. Currently, students apply separately to both universities.NTU became autonomous in 2006 and stands as one of the two largest public universities in Singapore today.NTU is currently a collaborative member of Singapore International Graduate Award for PhD applicants worldwide, which comprises Agency for Science, Technology & Research (A*STAR), the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).\\n\\nCampuses\\nLandscape and Architecture\\nNTU has been listed as one of the World\\'s Most Beautiful Universities, featuring the ADM building in the report.\\nIt has also been listed in \"The 10 most beautiful universities in East Asia\", featuring the Learning Hub building.\\nDuring NTI period between 1981 and 1982, the main campus layout including the building complex, the so-called North Spine, has been designed by a world-renowned Japanese architect, who is also 1987 Pritzker Prize winner, Kenzō Tange. The North Spine has been officially opened in 1986. The ADM building, featured in \"Travel + Lesiure\" report, has been designed by a young Singaporean architect Lee Cheng Wee.\\n The Learning Hub building, also called the Hive, featured in \"Times Higher Education\" report, has been designed by a British designer Thomas Heatherwick.\\n\\nYunnan Garden Campus\\nThe main campus of Nanyang Technological University is the 200-hectare (2.0 km2; 0.77 sq mi) Yunnan Garden Campus (Chinese: 云南园) which is situated adjacent to the town of Jurong West. It is the largest university campus on the island of Singapore, housing Singapore\\'s largest on-campus residence infrastructure including 24 halls of residence for undergraduates and two graduate halls.\\nThe campus grounds were originally donated by the Singapore Hokkien Association to Nanyang University. In 1981, the Nanyang University grounds were granted to the Nanyang Technological Institute, a newly formed English-medium engineering college. With the formation of the NTU through NTI\\'s merger with the National Institute of Education (NIE), the grounds were then presented to the university.\\nThe former Nanyang University administration building was restored into the Chinese Heritage Centre and was gazetted as a national monument in 1998 – now overlooking the Yunnan Garden. As of 2019, the Yunnan Garden is undergoing major renovations that will be completed in 2021. However some of it has been partially opened to the public in early 2020 The Nanyang University Memorial and original Nanyang University Arch were also declared national monuments of Singapore in 1998. The NTU Art & Heritage Museum is an approved public museum under the National Heritage Board’s Approved Museum Scheme; benefactors who donate artworks and artefacts to NTU enjoy double tax deductions. There is a small lake between the Chinese Heritage Centre and Hall of Residence 4 called Nanyang Lake. Only members of NTU Anglers\\' Club permit holder, the fishing club at NTU, are allowed to fish in this lake.The campus also served as the Youth Olympic Village for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010.\\n\\nNovena Campus\\nA third campus, Novena Campus, is situated close to LKCMedicine’s partner teaching hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital in downtown Novena for medical teaching and research at the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. The new 20-storey Clinical Sciences Building was completed in 2016. The CSB is home to LKCMedicine researchers, with the laboratories interconnected through collaborative spaces.\\n\\nUndergraduate halls\\nNTU has 23 Halls of Residence for undergraduates, each with a capacity of between 500 and 659 residents. They accommodate 14,000 local and international students, with every freshman guaranteed a hostel room. All halls are co-ed by floor or wing and offer single and double occupancy rooms. Double rooms are shared by residents of the same gender.\\nEvery hall has communal facilities like lounges, air-conditioned reading rooms, pantries and laundry rooms with washing machines and dryers. Presently, freshmen students will be guaranteed a room for two years.\\n\\nTransportation\\nTransportation to and around NTU is provided by means of campus shuttle buses. The Campus Loop Red and Blue services circle the campus, while the Campus Rider service connects the campus to the Pioneer MRT station.\\n\\nColleges and schools\\nNTU is organised into several colleges and schools, each corresponding to different fields of study. The founding colleges include the College of Engineering, Nanyang Business School, Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, and the National Institute of Education, which have been part of NTU since its inception in 1991.\\nMore recently, NTU has established additional schools for the Biological Sciences (2001), Humanities and Social Sciences (2004), Physical & Mathematical Sciences (2005), S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (2007), and Art, Design and Media (2009). In 2013, NTU and Imperial College London jointly established a new medical school, the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, which is based in the Novena campus along 11 Mandalay Road. In October 2016, the university announced that Humanities and Social Sciences would be expanded into two separate schools, namely the School of Humanities and the School of Social Sciences.\\n\\nNanyang Business School\\nNanyang Business School (NBS) is the largest business school in Singapore with over 6,800 undergraduates and postgraduates. It is also the No.1 business school in Singapore and 3rd in the Asia-Pacific region according to the Financial Times. For 13 consecutive years since 2004, the Nanyang MBA has been ranked the best in Singapore according to The Economist. NBS has more than 160 professors from more than 20 countries, proficient in 30 languages holding doctorates from the most renowned universities in the world. This makes NBS one of the largest business schools in the world in terms of faculty strength.NBS is the only business school in Singapore to offer the 3-year direct-honours single degree programme in Business or Accountancy. Its widely popular double degree programme in Accountancy and Business can be completed within 3.5 – 4 years, and the newly introduced integrated Bachelor & Master\\'s programme takes 4 years to complete. Students enrolled into the Business programme are allowed to specialise in their penultimate year of study in one of six areas, namely: Actuarial Science, Banking & Finance, Business Analytics, Human Resource Consulting, Marketing, Risk Management and Insurance.

Noor – Political Scientist and Historian\\n\\nControversies & Incidents\\nRenaming controversy\\nAlthough NTU occupies the grounds of the former Nanyang University (NU), and has a similar name, it is not a direct continuation of that institution. In 1980, the Government of Singapore forcibly merged Nanyang University with the University of Singapore to form the present-day National University of Singapore (NUS).  This was a source of significant discontent amongst NU students and alumni, because NU had been a Chinese-medium university, whereas the newly merged NUS was (and is) an English-medium university.\\nAs NTU subsequently grew into a full university, various efforts were made to have it claim the Nanyang University mantle. In 1996, the alumni rolls of Nanyang University were transferred from NUS to NTU. In 1998, the prominent local calligrapher and poet Pan Shou, who had been the first vice-chancellor of Nanyang University, called for NTU to be renamed Nanyang University, as a way to \"quieten the hearts of many\" NU alumni. In 2003, this idea received further support from NTU president Su Guaning, during an interview with the Chinese-language paper Lianhe Zaobao. One reason offered for the renaming was that, by the mid-2000s, NTU no longer had a narrow focus on technical subjects, but had become a full university including studies in the humanities.\\nThe renaming plans encountered push-back with a straw poll which NU alumni came out strongly against the idea and respondents complained that NTU could not provide \"continuity\" for the \"murdered\" Nanyang University.\\n\\nTenural denial to Cherian George\\nIn 2013, there was a debate over academic freedom in Singapore when Cherian George, an outspoken academic at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communications who had publicly criticised Singapore\\'s system of media control and its ruling People’s Action Party, did not get tenured. Although George had been recommended for tenure by the Wee Kim Wee School, his application was turned down by a university-level committee which included representatives from the Government of Singapore. One of the reviewers for the tenure case, Cardiff University\\'s Karin Wahl-Jorgensen, expressed outrage at NTU\\'s decision, and George\\'s thesis advisor, Stanford University\\'s Theodore Glasser, raised doubts about \"NTU\\'s reputation as a university of international standing\" and \"NTU\\'s commitment to academic freedom\". Despite a petition against the tenure decision by students at the Wee Kim Wee School, George\\'s appeal against the tenure decision was subsequently rejected by the university.\\n\\nReduced University student housing during COVID-19 pandemic\\nIn July 2021, NTU rejected some students\\' applications for on-campus hostel accommodations, citing a need to \"reserve a certain number for Covid-19 isolation and other related purposes\". The university claimed that the rejections were due to a shortage of housing facilities, which at full capacity was still unable to house every applicant, as rooms were oversubscribed. Even at full capacity, hostel accommodation was still short of more than 1,200 rooms for students.The application rejections resulted in concern among NTU\\'s international student population, who were told to vacate their rooms in 2 weeks. This also resulted in many returning second-year students enrolled in AY20/21 not being granted campus accommodation despite the university\\'s much-publicised policy of guaranteeing all incoming students with a minimum of two years of on-campus accommodation.An online petition by students in support of international students and incoming freshmen students who were initially promised accommodations garnered traction, gaining over 5,500 signatories. NTU reversed their decision on 2 July 2021, prioritising on-campus accommodations for international students that resided on campus at the time, students under scholarship programmes with guaranteed housing, and all Year 1 and 2 students under the guaranteed hall stay policy.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website'"

              "'The Nanyang Technological University (NTU) is a national research university based in Singapore. It is the second oldest autonomous university in Singapore and is considered to be one of the top universities in the world. NTU is consistently ranked within the top 20 universities in the world according to most rankings, and is currently ranked 12th globally in the QS World University Rankings as of June 2021. It has also been ranked 1st amongst young universities by the QS World University Rankings since 2015 as of April 2021As a relatively large university, it has 23,951 full-time enrolled students and 3846 full-time teaching staff. \\nThe university is organised into several colleges and schools, including the College of Engineering, College of Science, Nanyang Business School, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Graduate College, National Institute of Education, and S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. NTU is also home to several Research Centres of Excellence such as the Earth Observatory of Singapore and Singapore Centre on Environmental Life Sciences Engineering. \\nNTU\\'s main campus covers 200 hectares (490 acres) of land, making it the largest university campus in Singapore. The primary campus grounds are located in the western part of Singapore, along 50 Nanyang Avenue. It also has two other campuses in Singapore\\'s healthcare and start-up districts, Novena and one-north respectively.\\n\\nHistory\\nNanyang University (1955–1980)\\nIn 1955, prior to Singapore\\'s independence from the British, Nanyang University was established south of the current Nanyang Technological University campus, with the centre of the present Yunnan Garden as its heart. Its administration building currently houses the Chinese Heritage Centre, a national monument.\\n\\nNanyang Technological Institute (1981–1991)\\nIn 1980, Nanyang University merged with the University of Singapore to form the current National University of Singapore. In complement, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI), a tertiary institution affiliated to the National University of Singapore, was formed to take over Nanyang University\\'s campus in 1981.Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was set up on 1 August 1981 with a charter to train three-quarters of Singapore’s engineers.\\nWhen NTI started in 1982, it had a total student population of 582 in three engineering disciplines – civil and structural, electrical and electronic, and mechanical and production engineering. By 1990, the institute’s undergraduate student population had grown to 6,832. The first two graduate students were admitted in 1986.\\nThree engineering schools were added, and the School of Accountancy from the National University of Singapore was transferred to NTI in 1987. A school of applied science was also started. In 1990, the government announced that the Institute of Education would be merged with the College of Physical Education to form the National Institute of Education and that it would be part of the new NTU upon its establishment in 1991.\\n\\nPresent form\\nIn 1991, NTI merged with the National Institute of Education (NIE) (founded in 1950) to form the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The alumni rolls of the former Nanyang University were transferred to NTU in 1996. Historically, Nanyang Technological University admitted students jointly with the affiliated National University of Singapore and charged the same fees. Students made only one application and they would be accepted by either university. This arrangement ended in 2004 as both universities began to distinguish themselves with an end of its official affiliation. Currently, students apply separately to both universities.NTU became autonomous in 2006 and stands as one of the two largest public universities in Singapore today.NTU is currently a collaborative member of Singapore International Graduate Award for PhD applicants worldwide, which comprises Agency for Science, Technology & Research (A*STAR), the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).\\n\\nCampuses\\nLandscape and Architecture\\nNTU has been listed as one of the World\\'s Most Beautiful Universities, featuring the ADM building in the report.\\nIt has also been listed in \"The 10 most beautiful universities in East Asia\", featuring the Learning Hub building.\\nDuring NTI period between 1981 and 1982, the main campus layout including the building complex, the so-called North Spine, has been designed by a world-renowned Japanese architect, who is also 1987 Pritzker Prize winner, Kenzō Tange. The North Spine has been officially opened in 1986. The ADM building, featured in \"Travel + Lesiure\" report, has been designed by a young Singaporean architect Lee Cheng Wee.\\n The Learning Hub building, also called the Hive, featured in \"Times Higher Education\" report, has been designed by a British designer Thomas Heatherwick.\\n\\nYunnan Garden Campus\\nThe main campus of Nanyang Technological University is the 200-hectare (2.0 km2; 0.77 sq mi) Yunnan Garden Campus (Chinese: 云南园) which is situated adjacent to the town of Jurong West. It is the largest university campus on the island of Singapore, housing Singapore\\'s largest on-campus residence infrastructure including 24 halls of residence for undergraduates and two graduate halls.\\nThe campus grounds were originally donated by the Singapore Hokkien Association to Nanyang University. In 1981, the Nanyang University grounds were granted to the Nanyang Technological Institute, a newly formed English-medium engineering college. With the formation of the NTU through NTI\\'s merger with the National Institute of Education (NIE), the grounds were then presented to the university.\\nThe former Nanyang University administration building was restored into the Chinese Heritage Centre and was gazetted as a national monument in 1998 – now overlooking the Yunnan Garden. As of 2019, the Yunnan Garden is undergoing major renovations that will be completed in 2021. However some of it has been partially opened to the public in early 2020 The Nanyang University Memorial and original Nanyang University Arch were also declared national monuments of Singapore in 1998. The NTU Art & Heritage Museum is an approved public museum under the National Heritage Board’s Approved Museum Scheme; benefactors who donate artworks and artefacts to NTU enjoy double tax deductions. There is a small lake between the Chinese Heritage Centre and Hall of Residence 4 called Nanyang Lake. Only members of NTU Anglers\\' Club permit holder, the fishing club at NTU, are allowed to fish in this lake.The campus also served as the Youth Olympic Village for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010.\\n\\nNovena Campus\\nA third campus, Novena Campus, is situated close to LKCMedicine’s partner teaching hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital in downtown Novena for medical teaching and research at the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. The new 20-storey Clinical Sciences Building was completed in 2016. The CSB is home to LKCMedicine researchers, with the laboratories interconnected through collaborative spaces.\\n\\nUndergraduate halls\\nNTU has 23 Halls of Residence for undergraduates, each with a capacity of between 500 and 659 residents. They accommodate 14,000 local and international students, with every freshman guaranteed a hostel room. All halls are co-ed by floor or wing and offer single and double occupancy rooms. Double rooms are shared by residents of the same gender.\\nEvery hall has communal facilities like lounges, air-conditioned reading rooms, pantries and laundry rooms with washing machines and dryers. Presently, freshmen students will be guaranteed a room for two years.\\n\\nTransportation\\nTransportation to and around NTU is provided by means of campus shuttle buses. The Campus Loop Red and Blue services circle the campus, while the Campus Rider service connects the campus to the Pioneer MRT station.\\n\\nColleges and schools\\nNTU is organised into several colleges and schools, each corresponding to different fields of study. The founding colleges include the College of Engineering, Nanyang Business School, Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, and the National Institute of Education, which have been part of NTU since its inception in 1991.\\nMore recently, NTU has established additional schools for the Biological Sciences (2001), Humanities and Social Sciences (2004), Physical & Mathematical Sciences (2005), S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (2007), and Art, Design and Media (2009). In 2013, NTU and Imperial College London jointly established a new medical school, the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, which is based in the Novena campus along 11 Mandalay Road. In October 2016, the university announced that Humanities and Social Sciences would be expanded into two separate schools, namely the School of Humanities and the School of Social Sciences.\\n\\nNanyang Business School\\nNanyang Business School (NBS) is the largest business school in Singapore with over 6,800 undergraduates and postgraduates. It is also the No.1 business school in Singapore and 3rd in the Asia-Pacific region according to the Financial Times. For 13 consecutive years since 2004, the Nanyang MBA has been ranked the best in Singapore according to The Economist. NBS has more than 160 professors from more than 20 countries, proficient in 30 languages holding doctorates from the most renowned universities in the world. This makes NBS one of the largest business schools in the world in terms of faculty strength.NBS is the only business school in Singapore to offer the 3-year direct-honours single degree programme in Business or Accountancy. Its widely popular double degree programme in Accountancy and Business can be completed within 3.5 – 4 years, and the newly introduced integrated Bachelor & Master\\'s programme takes 4 years to complete.

Noor – Political Scientist and Historian\\n\\nControversies & Incidents\\nRenaming controversy\\nAlthough NTU occupies the grounds of the former Nanyang University (NU), and has a similar name, it is not a direct continuation of that institution. In 1980, the Government of Singapore forcibly merged Nanyang University with the University of Singapore to form the present-day National University of Singapore (NUS).  This was a source of significant discontent amongst NU students and alumni, because NU had been a Chinese-medium university, whereas the newly merged NUS was (and is) an English-medium university.\\nAs NTU subsequently grew into a full university, various efforts were made to have it claim the Nanyang University mantle. In 1996, the alumni rolls of Nanyang University were transferred from NUS to NTU. In 1998, the prominent local calligrapher and poet Pan Shou, who had been the first vice-chancellor of Nanyang University, called for NTU to be renamed Nanyang University, as a way to \"quieten the hearts of many\" NU alumni. In 2003, this idea received further support from NTU president Su Guaning, during an interview with the Chinese-language paper Lianhe Zaobao. One reason offered for the renaming was that, by the mid-2000s, NTU no longer had a narrow focus on technical subjects, but had become a full university including studies in the humanities.\\nThe renaming plans encountered push-back with a straw poll which NU alumni came out strongly against the idea and respondents complained that NTU could not provide \"continuity\" for the \"murdered\" Nanyang University.\\n\\nTenural denial to Cherian George\\nIn 2013, there was a debate over academic freedom in Singapore when Cherian George, an outspoken academic at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communications who had publicly criticised Singapore\\'s system of media control and its ruling People’s Action Party, did not get tenured. Although George had been recommended for tenure by the Wee Kim Wee School, his application was turned down by a university-level committee which included representatives from the Government of Singapore. One of the reviewers for the tenure case, Cardiff University\\'s Karin Wahl-Jorgensen, expressed outrage at NTU\\'s decision, and George\\'s thesis advisor, Stanford University\\'s Theodore Glasser, raised doubts about \"NTU\\'s reputation as a university of international standing\" and \"NTU\\'s commitment to academic freedom\". Despite a petition against the tenure decision by students at the Wee Kim Wee School, George\\'s appeal against the tenure decision was subsequently rejected by the university.\\n\\nReduced University student housing during COVID-19 pandemic\\nIn July 2021, NTU rejected some students\\' applications for on-campus hostel accommodations, citing a need to \"reserve a certain number for Covid-19 isolation and other related purposes\". The university claimed that the rejections were due to a shortage of housing facilities, which at full capacity was still unable to house every applicant, as rooms were oversubscribed. Even at full capacity, hostel accommodation was still short of more than 1,200 rooms for students.The application rejections resulted in concern among NTU\\'s international student population, who were told to vacate their rooms in 2 weeks. This also resulted in many returning second-year students enrolled in AY20/21 not being granted campus accommodation despite the university\\'s much-publicised policy of guaranteeing all incoming students with a minimum of two years of on-campus accommodation.An online petition by students in support of international students and incoming freshmen students who were initially promised accommodations garnered traction, gaining over 5,500 signatories. NTU reversed their decision on 2 July 2021, prioritising on-campus accommodations for international students that resided on campus at the time, students under scholarship programmes with guaranteed housing, and all Year 1 and 2 students under the guaranteed hall stay policy.\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website'"
