# Introduction to Vision tasks

Key question: Why do we use Convolutional Neural Networks for Vision tasks?

- Some vision tasks: 
    - Basic: image classification, object detection and segmentation
    - landmark recognition, image generation, object tracking, monocular depth estimation
    - Point cloud data (3d)
    - Video classification (action recognition), video detection and segmentation
    - Others: pose estimation, re-identification (Face ID)
- How image data is stored on computers
- Convolution: what it is, what are its properties?
- Convolutional Neural Networks: components and structure

Advanced materials
- Types of convolutions used in CNNs: 
    - depth-wise separable convolution (MobileNet, EfficientNet)
    - point-wise (1x1) convolution
    - group convolution
    - dilated (atrous) convolution (object detection and segmentation)
    - deformable convolution (object detection and segmentation)
- Notable CNN architectures
    - ResNet
    - MobileNet
- Compare convolution with transformer's attention
- Transformer-based models for vision tasks: ViT, DETR
